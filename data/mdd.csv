This screening will take approximately 5-10 minutes. If you agree to participate in this screening, you will be asked information about your medical history, psychiatric history, and current psychiatric state. Your participation in this online screening is entirely voluntary. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You may choose not to answer questions if you wish, and you may stop the questionnaire at any time. Information about you that you give during this interview will be kept as confidential as possible as required by law. Your information will be stored in a secure electronic filing system. Aside from ethnicity, no part of your answers will be shared with anyone outside our study staff. However, if you appear to be in immediate danger of harming yourself or someone else, we may be required to contact local police to confirm your safety. It is also possible that the Food and Drug Administration, and other federal and state authorities, may inspect our records. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you refuse to answer the questions or stop answering them at any time, there will be no penalty, and you will not lose any benefits to which you otherwise would be entitled. The risk in responding to this questionnaire is very small. It is possible that some people may feel uncomfortable answering these questions. The information will be kept confidential as noted, but there is a small risk that people outside of the research team could learn this information. The benefit to you of taking part in this interview is that you will find out whether you can take part in one of our studies. Some individuals also appreciate the opportunity to reflect on these questions. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You will not be paid for answering questions in this survey since it is only to see whether you qualify to take part in a study. Following our conversation today, if you do not qualify for a study at this time, you may choose to allow us to contact you about future studies. If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about this interview, you can contact the principal investigator (Dr. Keller at kellerlab@stanford.edu). Or, if you want general information about your participant rights, you can contact the university Institutional Review Board (1-866-680-2906).</span></p> <p> </p></div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,
